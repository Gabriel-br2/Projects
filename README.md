# ðŸš€ My Coding Journey & Project Archive

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my project archive. This repository contains a collection of some of my university assignments and personal creations, showcasing my journey through the worlds of Python, C, C++, and embedded systems. These are just a few of the projects I've worked on, but they represent important steps in my learning. Feel free to explore!

## ðŸ“‚ Projects  

### ðŸ§  Activity and Exercises
A collection of my solutions for various coding challenges, primarily from the [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/) platform (formerly URI Online Judge). It's a great way to practice logic and learn the nuances of different languages.

* **Languages:** `Python`, `C`, and `C++`
* **Content:** A wide variety of solved algorithmic problems.

### ðŸ’¡ Control System
A hands-on project from my Control Systems class in Automation Engineering. This code implements a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to regulate the brightness of a high-intensity LED based on ambient light.

* **Hardware:** `Arduino`
* **Components:** Photosensor, High-Brightness LED
* **Core Concept:** Real-world application of PID control theory.

### ðŸ”— Data Structure
This folder contains all the fundamental data structure concepts I implemented during my university course. All exercises and examples are coded purely in `C`.

* **Topics Covered:**
    * Dynamic Memory Allocation
    * Binary Search
    * Searching and Sorting Algorithms
    * Binary and Text File Manipulation
    * Dynamic Programming

### ðŸŽ¨ Matrix LED Draw
This project holds a special place in my heart. It's a pixel art and animation tool that uses the Pygame library to create a 16x32 canvas.

> **A personal note on this project:**
> *While this was my second major project overall, it was the **first one born entirely from my own idea**, as my very first project was a university assignment. While I now know there are countless ways to improve its structure (hello, spaghetti code! ðŸ˜„), I'm incredibly proud of what I was able to build as a beginner. It has a ton of features built from scratch and represents a significant and joyful step in my creative coding journey.*

* **Core Engine:** `pygame`
* **Key Features:**
    * **16x32 Pixel Canvas:** Create and manage frames for animations.
    * **Drawing Tools:** Paint pixels, and draw lines, squares, and circles.
    * **Frame Management:** Easily create, duplicate, and edit animation frames.
    * **Color Palette:** Save and load your favorite RGB colors.
    * **File I/O:** Animations (`saved_anim/`) and colors (`color_saved.txt`) are saved to `.txt` files.
